  - Be respectful
  - Wait for feedback from other people
  - Wait for an approval by a maintainer (an associated issue will automatically be created)
- Perform editions and open [pull request](https://github.com/lowlighter/gracidea/pulls)
  - Ensure that all builds are passing
  - Preview you changes through the [Vercel](https://vercel.com) deployment link
  - Wait for reviews
- Pull request will be merged if approved, thanks for contributing ü•≥ !

## üó∫Ô∏è For mappers

### ü§ù Accepted contributions

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Any change **must** be motivated through official supporting references, such as games, anime, manga or promotional artworks (in this prefered order).
>
> Not following this instruction may result in a pull request closure without notice

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Apart from first generations core games, other mapping sources will require a bit of creativity and adaption. The aim is to be faithful while making these custom maps integrate nicely. Most of the time, it means:
> - Making important building or features present
> - Respect more or less the map scale
> - Not bloating a map section with too much tiles

- ‚úîÔ∏è Fix maps and/or textures errors
- ‚úîÔ∏è Add or create new maps (in the following preference order):
  - ‚úîÔ∏è From core games
  - ‚úîÔ∏è From spin-offs game
  - ‚úîÔ∏è From anime or manga
  - ‚úîÔ∏è From promotional artworks
  - ‚úîÔ∏è Custom fillers maps
- ‚úîÔ∏è Add or create new textures
  - *‚ö†Ô∏è New textures styles are allowed provided they respect a given core game style*

### üì¶ Requirements

- Mapping knowledge
  - [Tiled map editor](https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/) general knowledge
- Mapping environment
  - [Tiled map editor](https://www.mapeditor.org)
  - [TexturePacker](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker)
    - *‚ö†Ô∏è A license may be required to regenerate textures*
  - Any image editing software

GitHub users having access to [GitHub codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) may directly use the custom container with all dependencies installed (this also include [Tiled map editor](https://www.mapeditor.org) which is accessible through [NoVNC](https://novnc.com))

### üìö How-to

#### Map editions

Open [Tiled map editor](https://www.mapeditor.org) and load [`maps/gracidea.world`](/maps/gracidea.world).
Start editing a new map file or an existing map file.

- Maps filenames **must** follow this convention:
  - `${region}/${location-area}.tmx` for official maps, where `location-area` is defined in [pokeapi.co/api/v2/location-area](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/location-area)
  - `${region}/anime-${name}.tmx` for anime locations
  - `${region}/manga-${name}.tmx` for manga locations
  - `${region}/fill-${number}.tmx` for custom filler maps, where `number` is an unused number
- Maps layers **must** follow this convention and have:
  - `creatures` object layer for area with wild encounters
    - Create a new polygon having name set to an `encounter-method` defined in [pokeapi.co/api/v2/encounter-method](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/encounter-method)
    - *‚ÑπÔ∏è Encounter rates are auto-generated and do not need any further editions*
  - `people` object layer for human NPCs
    - Create a new polygon having name set to a [supported NPC texture](/copyrighted/textures/rse/npcs.json), and type set to a [supported NPC pattern](https://github.com/lowlighter/gracidea/blob/74505b775d2a4eace0e61e05dc263bff28a9afa7/app/client/js/app/maps/npc.human.ts#L99-L106)
  - `${X}` tiles layer where `X` is a number between `1` and `4`
    - Use the tileset to fill this map, with these guidelines:
      - `1` Ground tiles
      - `2` Secondary ground tiles (road paths, flowers, grass, etc.)
      - `3` Objects (houses, trees, panels, etc.)
      - `4` High objects (roof, tree top, etc.)
    - Sea **must** not be mapped

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è A world map must then be added to `gracidea.world` and saved

#### World map editions

Open [Tiled map editor](https://www.mapeditor.org) and load [`maps/all/worldmap.tmx`](/maps/all/worldmap.tmx).
Start editing file.

- World map layers **must** follow this convention:
  - `links` object layer for location link
    - Create a new polygon and set name to `${region}/${location-area}` where `location-area` is defined in [pokeapi.co/api/v2/location-area](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/location-area)
  - `interests.*` tiles layer is used for interests points
  - `cities.*` tiles layer is used for cities and towns
  - `roads.*` tiles layer is used for roads
  - `${region}` image layer needs to reference a [supported region](/copyrighted/textures/all/regions)
  - `roads.sea` tiles layer is used for sea roads which needs to appear below regions render
  - `*.ext` layers are used to define locations from extended sources, such as spin-offs, anime, manga, etc.
  - `*.core` layers are used to define locations from core games

#### Textures editions (specific style)

Open `copyrighted/textures/${style}/tileset.png` where `style` is a supported style (any folder except `all`).
Start editing file.

Create new tiles on "MissingNo" placeholders and try to group related tiles together.

> ‚õî Do not resize `tileset.png`, its dimensions are used internally for other applications

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Other files such as `creatures.{json,tps,webp}`, `npcs.{json,webp}` and `tileset.{json,tps,tsx,webp}` should not be edited directly. They are either generated automatically or rebuilt with [TexturePacker](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker)

#### Texture editions (all)

Textures located in `copyrighted/textures/all` are handled differently than style texture packs.

For regular tilesets, edit the associated `.png` file and create new tiles on "MissingNo" placeholders and try to group related tiles together.

For world regions, create a new `.png` file in `copyrighted/textures/all/regions`.
